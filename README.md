### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control and to prepare for Final Project. This work will help me add to my portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be highlighted and shared in the future.

Here's what I worked on this past week...

**Week 1**: Data models and Test Driven Development are covered this week. A efficient/normalized data model for https://ship-it.netlify.app/ (a front in ready for data and api integration) is created as well as and Express API server and functional tests are included to check HTTP data request validity.

**Week 2**: Week 2 focuses on error handling through sequelize, node.js and CircleCI. From error handling event logging and debugging techniques are also practiced.

**Week 3**:

Two additions to this project are scheduled for week 3.
A. Implement redux to handle the management of state.
B. Add JSON web token (JWT) authorization to user login ability.

**Week 4**:
